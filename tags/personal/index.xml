One of the most satisfying feelings in life is when you&rsquo;re able to solve a problem that you have in life by yourself (and a bit of internet research, of course), be that repairing some tech, designing a CAD model that fits perfectly into some nook, or even just turning something off and on again.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>A Year of City Walks</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/walk-walk-walk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 13:35:51 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/walk-walk-walk/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I started off this year with a bunch of goals. Not sure if this is just me slowly entering my quarter-life crisis, but I&rsquo;ve been trying to (re)discover hobbies, find out things about myself and just do some soul-searching in general. While I might&rsquo;ve given up on a bunch of these (RIP the dusty guitar in the corner of my room), the one goal I can say that I&rsquo;m satisfied with has been one to travel. I believe I&rsquo;ve been to more places this year than any other year of my life.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Cafes, Curries and Other Adulting Adventures</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/adulting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 12:01:36 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/adulting/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a good while since I&rsquo;ve come back to this blog. It&rsquo;s something I always think I should do, but I just never get around to doing it. I can&rsquo;t seem to shake the feeling that I will come back here in ten years and look to this blog in nostalgia. So, I figure it&rsquo;s good to document what this point in my life was like. Why that has to be on a public blog on the Internet, I cannot explain.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>College: Calicut, Coding and COVID</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/college-retrospect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 16:28:59 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/college-retrospect/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>A week back, my undergrad college (<a href="https://nitc.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NITC</a>) education came to an end. Though I spent around a half of it sitting at my desk at home staring at a screen, I&rsquo;m still leaving the place with a bunch of fond memories, some great experiences and an itch to talk about all of it. Luckily, I have this blog which has patiently been waiting for me to come scream into the void again.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
