<p>We decided to put up some lights around the house for this year&rsquo;s Christmas. As is my curse, I decided to whip up some fancy rainbow animations using a bunch of <a href="https://googlethatforyou.com?q=WS2811%20led" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">WS2811</a> LEDs and a NodeMCU that I had lying around. (see: <a href="/projects/leaprgb/" rel="">LeapRGB</a>)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unique about these LEDs is that each one contains an IC; as such, it allows you to individually control each LED in the strip. A typical LED strip might have a power and a ground line and have the entire strip light up uniformly. Here, we have a power, ground and a data line that can be fed using a microcontroller.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>On GNU/Linux and Ricing</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/gnulinux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 17:13:01 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/gnulinux/</guid><description><![CDATA[<data id="id-1" data-raw></data>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>No blog of mine is complete without a rant (and/or flex) about GNU/Linux and my choice of distro (take a guess). An introduction to the terms mentioned here for any uninitiated (non-existent) readers:-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GNU/Linux</strong> (popularly <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">and arguably</a> known as Linux): An open-source operating system (which can be <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">free</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Rice</strong>: a swamp grass which is widely cultivated as a source of food</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have the essential information, we can get on to the story of how my experience with Linux led me to start a tech-repair empire by <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Did%20You%20Try%20Putting%20It%20In%20Rice%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">&ldquo;putting it in rice&rdquo;</a>. I was approximately 0.38 years old when I first laid eyes on a rice grain &hellip;..</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Setting Up a Website</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:05:38 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="evil-backstory">(Evil) Backstory</h2>
<p>So, I finally decided to buy myself a domain and put myself out there on the interwebs. This obviously isn&rsquo;t my first presence on the internet (throwback to pre-affordable-internet days when I used to sit around scrolling on the sand as opposed to almighty machine learning overlord curated content).</p>
<h3 id="old-website">Old Website</h3>
<p>I even used to have a website before this one. Right around the time I created a GitHub, I managed to whip up a simple landing page for myself which has been available at <a href="https://clifordjoshy.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">clifordjoshy.github.io</a> for the past three years. By the time this goes up, that site (that I&rsquo;ll let you know took me a whole night to figure out the CSS for) would&rsquo;ve been long buried in some Microsoft cache somewhere. As a remembrance of the website that&rsquo;s been with me throughout my (villainous?) journey, I&rsquo;ll leave here a screenshot.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
