&lt;p&gt;So, I finally decided to buy myself a domain and put myself out there on the interwebs. This obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t my first presence on the internet (throwback to pre-affordable-internet days when I used to sit around scrolling on the sand as opposed to almighty machine learning overlord curated content).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="old-website"&gt;Old Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even used to have a website before this one. Right around the time I created a GitHub, I managed to whip up a simple landing page for myself which has been available at &lt;a href="https://clifordjoshy.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;clifordjoshy.github.io&lt;/a&gt; for the past three years. By the time this goes up, that site (that I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know took me a whole night to figure out the CSS for) would&amp;rsquo;ve been long buried in some Microsoft cache somewhere. As a remembrance of the website that&amp;rsquo;s been with me throughout my (villainous?) journey, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave here a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
