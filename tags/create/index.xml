As is my curse, I decided to whip up some fancy rainbow animations using a bunch of WS2811 LEDs and a NodeMCU that I had lying around. (see: LeapRGB)
What&amp;rsquo;s unique about these LEDs is that each one contains an IC; as such, it allows you to individually control each LED in the strip. A typical LED strip might have a power and a ground line and have the entire strip light up uniformly.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up a Website</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:05:38 +0530</pubDate><author>Cliford</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</guid><description>(Evil) Backstory So, I finally decided to buy myself a domain and put myself out there on the interwebs. This obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t my first presence on the internet (throwback to pre-affordable-internet days when I used to sit around scrolling on the sand as opposed to almighty machine learning overlord curated content).
Old Website I even used to have a website before this one. Right around the time I created a GitHub, I managed to whip up a simple landing page for myself which has been available at clifordjoshy.</description></item></channel></rss>
