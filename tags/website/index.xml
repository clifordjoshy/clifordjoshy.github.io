<p>So, I finally decided to buy myself a domain and put myself out there on the interwebs. This obviously isn&rsquo;t my first presence on the internet (throwback to pre-affordable-internet days when I used to sit around scrolling on the sand as opposed to almighty machine learning overlord curated content).</p>
<h3 id="old-website">Old Website</h3>
<p>I even used to have a website before this one. Right around the time I created a GitHub, I managed to whip up a simple landing page for myself which has been available at <a href="https://clifordjoshy.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">clifordjoshy.github.io</a> for the past three years. By the time this goes up, that site (that I&rsquo;ll let you know took me a whole night to figure out the CSS for) would&rsquo;ve been long buried in some Microsoft cache somewhere. As a remembrance of the website that&rsquo;s been with me throughout my (villainous?) journey, I&rsquo;ll leave here a screenshot.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
