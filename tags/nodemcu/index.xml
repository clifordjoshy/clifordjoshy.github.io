<p>We decided to put up some lights around the house for this year&rsquo;s Christmas. As is my curse, I decided to whip up some fancy rainbow animations using a bunch of <a href="https://googlethatforyou.com?q=WS2811%20led" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">WS2811</a> LEDs and a NodeMCU that I had lying around. (see: <a href="/projects/leaprgb/" rel="">LeapRGB</a>)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unique about these LEDs is that each one contains an IC; as such, it allows you to individually control each LED in the strip. A typical LED strip might have a power and a ground line and have the entire strip light up uniformly. Here, we have a power, ground and a data line that can be fed using a microcontroller.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
