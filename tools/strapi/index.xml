Ragam'21 and Tathva'20 were conducted online and required a REST API capable of handling event registrations, submissions, payments, team management and other event-specific requirements.
Ragam'22 was (finally) offline and had a completely different set of requirements on top of the pre-existing design. It required the verification of attendees at the venues and events, hostel allocation, special registration conditions and the addition of an admin API.</description></item></channel></rss>
