It&rsquo;s something I always think I should do, but I just never get around to doing it. I can&rsquo;t seem to shake the feeling that I will come back here in ten years and look to this blog in nostalgia. So, I figure it&rsquo;s good to document what this point in my life was like. Why that has to be on a public blog on the Internet, I cannot explain.]]></description></item><item><title>College: Calicut, Coding and COVID</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/college-retrospect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 16:28:59 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/college-retrospect/</guid><description>A week back, my undergrad college (NITC) education came to an end. Though I spent around a half of it sitting at my desk at home staring at a screen, I&amp;rsquo;m still leaving the place with a bunch of fond memories, some great experiences and an itch to talk about all of it. Luckily, I have this blog which has patiently been waiting for me to come scream into the void again.</description></item><item><title>Microcontrollers, Mathematics and a Merry Christmas</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/microcontrollers-mathematics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 22:13:31 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/microcontrollers-mathematics/</guid><description>Prelude We decided to put up some lights around the house for this year&amp;rsquo;s Christmas. As is my curse, I decided to whip up some fancy rainbow animations using a bunch of WS2811 LEDs and a NodeMCU that I had lying around. (see: LeapRGB)
What&amp;rsquo;s unique about these LEDs is that each one contains an IC; as such, it allows you to individually control each LED in the strip. A typical LED strip might have a power and a ground line and have the entire strip light up uniformly.</description></item><item><title>On GNU/Linux and Ricing</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/gnulinux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 17:13:01 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/gnulinux/</guid><description>Intro No blog of mine is complete without a rant (and/or flex) about GNU/Linux and my choice of distro (take a guess). An introduction to the terms mentioned here for any uninitiated (non-existent) readers:-
GNU/Linux (popularly and arguably known as Linux): An open-source operating system (which can be free) Rice: a swamp grass which is widely cultivated as a source of food Now that we have the essential information, we can get on to the story of how my experience with Linux led me to start a tech-repair empire by &amp;ldquo;putting it in rice&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up a Website</title><link>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:05:38 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://cliford.net/posts/setting-up-a-website/</guid><description>(Evil) Backstory So, I finally decided to buy myself a domain and put myself out there on the interwebs. This obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t my first presence on the internet (throwback to pre-affordable-internet days when I used to sit around scrolling on the sand as opposed to almighty machine learning overlord curated content).
Old Website I even used to have a website before this one. Right around the time I created a GitHub, I managed to whip up a simple landing page for myself which has been available at clifordjoshy.</description></item></channel></rss>
