## Intro

No blog of mine is complete without a rant (and/or flex) about GNU/Linux and my choice of distro (take a guess). An introduction to the terms mentioned here for any uninititated (non-existent) readers:-
- **GNU/Linux** (popularly [and arguably](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html) known as Linux): An open-source operating system (which can be [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html))
- **Rice**: a swamp grass which is widely cultivated as a source of food

Now that we have the essential information, we can get on to the story of how my experience with Linux led me to start a tech-repair empire by ["putting it in rice"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Did%20You%20Try%20Putting%20It%20In%20Rice%3F). I was approximately 0.38 years old when I first laid eyes on a rice grain .....

Just kidding. I don't know why I felt the need to add in this pointless section, but you, a person who made a willing (unwise) choice to read this blog, only have yourself to blame. But, for real though
- **Ricing**: a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were.

The best way for you to actually see what I mean is to check out [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) - one of my favourite subreddits and the foremost forum where people post their rices.
